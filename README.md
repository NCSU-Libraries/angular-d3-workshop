# Getting Started with Angular and D3.js

This workshop was developed to help walk you through the creation of a data dashboard using Angular and D3.js. While it is not a step-by-step tutorial we have added extensive comments to the code. We have tried to highlight the most important steps in the process on this site. Most of the work you will be doing is uncommenting sections of code, in a sequential manner, to get a sense of how each component of the application works.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.6.4.
``
## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
